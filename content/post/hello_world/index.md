## Welcome to my blog

Here I regularly share my learning and projects. I'm interested in a wide range of topics spanning several branches of **Machine Learning** and **Statistics**.

My first articles are dedicated to **Reinforcement Learning**, the topic that inspired me to start my writing journey.

Here's a list of my current articles, as well as topics I'm planning to cover. For each category, I recommend that the following reading order:

### ***Reinforcement Learning***

[1](https://machine-learning-blog.vercel.app/p/markov_decision_processes/) Markov Decision Processes: framing Reinforcement Learning problems efficiently

[2](https://machine-learning-blog.vercel.app/p/bellman_equation/) The Bellman Equation: the fundamental equation of Reinforcement Learning

[3](https://machine-learning-blog.vercel.app/p/policy_iteration_frozen_lake/) Policy Iteration on Frozen Lake: solving a simple environment

[4](https://machine-learning-blog.vercel.app/p/td_learning_comparison/) Temporal-Difference Learning and the importance of exploration: an illustrated guide

### ***Machine Learning*** *(coming soon)*

[1] Coding a Neural Network from scratch with JAX: an illustrated guide

### ***Statistics*** *(coming soon)*

[1] The KL-Divergence: measuring distance between probability distributions
